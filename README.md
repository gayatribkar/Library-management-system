# Library-management-system

This is a librabry management system developed in my Second year. I used Python, file system, data structures etc. to make this project.

It contains following functionalities:
- In this system students can browse books along with the prices
- Students can borrow books 
- Students can return books
- Late fee is added. (No late fee - if books are returned before due date).
